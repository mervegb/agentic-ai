evaluator:
Your response provides a lot of useful information regarding flights from Amsterdam to Lisbon, including various airlines and their price ranges. However, there are a few areas for improvement:

1. **Specificity for June 2025**: You mention current pricing and availability, but the user is specifically looking for flights in June 2025. It would be beneficial to clarify that prices and availability may vary greatly as flight schedules for 2025 may not yet be fully released.

2. **Focus on Non-Stop Flights**: The user requested non-stop flights, but your response includes a lot of general information about various flights, including those that are not non-stop. Highlight which airlines offer direct flights for the specified month and year.

3. **Clarity & Structure**: Organizing the information more clearly would enhance readability. Consider using bullet points or sections to separate airlines, pricing, and non-stop options, making it easier for the user to find the information they need.

4. **Use of "Missing" Statements**: The repeated "Missing" statements can be distracting and may confuse the reader. Instead, ensure that all necessary information is presented cohesively.

5. **Recommendations for Searching**: While you mention platforms to find flights, providing tips on when to book for the best fare (like a general timeline before the travel date) would add value to your response.

Make these adjustments to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your response. Once addressed, I will respond with 'APPROVE'.
